Easy Smooth Scroll jQuery plugin for scrolling between two elements on 
the same page.

Simply add the class .smooth to any link you want to enable this plugin for,
and make the target of the a element the ID on the page you want to scroll for.

Example:
```
<a class="smooth" href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>
```
-Will scroll smoothly too-
```
<div id="contact-us">
 ...
</div>

```
Feel free to remove the console.log statements, they are just for my personal
error checking, and to see when the script fires.
